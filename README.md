# ToneRank

Tone Rank reads emails in an inbox and splits emails into two categories: emails which are from institutions, businesses, or organizations, and emails which are from individuals. 

Each category is ordered by tone and urgency, then the two sorted categories are presented in order; the first category first, and the second (personal email) category second.
